# Clothing Features Extraction and Product Recommendation System

This project aims to develop a system that can extract clothing attributes and provide personalized fashion recommendations to users using artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The main purpose of the system is to make users' shopping experiences more personal and enjoyable by recommending clothes that suit their clothing styles.

## Features

1. **Extracting Clothing Attributes**: Using artificial intelligence algorithms, we can accurately extract attributes of clothes such as color, pattern, and style.

2. **User Profile Creation**: We create personalized fashion profiles based on users' preferences and past purchases.

3. **Product Recommendation**: Based on user profiles and clothing attribute analysis, we provide users with specifically selected clothing recommendations.

4. **User Feedback**: We continually update our system by receiving user feedback on recommended products.

## How It Works

### 1. Data Collection and Processing

A large and diverse dataset is needed to extract clothing attributes and make combination recommendations. We collect data from various sources and perform data processing steps.

### 2. Feature Extraction

We use deep learning and data mining techniques to extract attributes of clothing items, including color, pattern, style, and seasonal suitability.

- **Color Analysis**: We determine the main colors of clothing items through color palette analysis on visual data.

- **Pattern Recognition**: Deep learning models and image processing techniques identify patterns in clothing items.

- **Style Identification**: The style of clothing items is categorized using style analysis, such as classic, sporty, bohemian, etc.

- **Seasonal Appropriateness**: We integrate date and weather data to determine the seasonal suitability of fashion products.

### 3. Deep Learning and Data Mining Techniques

We employ various techniques to enhance attribute extraction and recommendation:

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: Used for visual feature extraction, especially for pattern recognition and color analysis.

- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**: Applied to text data to analyze fashion trends and user comments.

- **Clustering Algorithms**: Separate clothing items into clusters based on attributes to provide users with specific combination suggestions.

### 4. Recommendation Algorithms

We develop and improve recommendation algorithms for personalized recommendations:

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Offers suggestions based on the preferences of other users with similar tastes.

- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends clothing items and other products with similar attributes based on the user's past preferences.

- **Hybrid Approaches**: Combine different recommendation algorithms to improve accuracy and the quality of personalized recommendations.
